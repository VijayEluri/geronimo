     - @EJB injection of ejb-refs and ejb-local-refs (Jetty)


- Web Services (CXF)
  Supported:
     - Deployng a JAX-WS based POJO service that leverages annotations to simplify the creation of the Web service.  
     - Deploying a traditional JAX-RPC based POJO service
     - @Resource Annotations are fully supported provided they are also defined in the web.xml deployment descriptor
     - The @Resource WebServiceContext annotation is fully supported.  

     Simple Web Services example available at: http://cwiki.apache.org/GMOxDOC20/simple-web-service-with-jax-ws.html

  Limitations:
     - No EJB support for Web Services in 2.0-M2
     - <service-ref> elements in the deployment descriptor or @WebServiceRef annotations are not processed.
     - Dynamically generated WSDL returned via ?wsdl request might be missing some information.
     - Dynamic clients (obtained using the javax.xml.ws.Service API) might not always work.


- JSTL 1.2
   Applications that use JSTL must add a dependency in their deployment plan to the jstl jar.
   Specifically:
    <dep:dependencies>
     <dep:dependency>
      <dep:groupId>jstl</dep:groupId>
      <dep:artifactId>jstl</dep:artifactId>
      </dep:dependency>
    </dep:dependencies>
   Alternatively, the jstl jar can be included in the application's WEB-INF/lib directory.


- JSF 1.2 - Not yet supported
 -JSF applications will deploy and start but will not execute yet. An updated MyFaces package
  will remedy this in the near future.

Installing & Starting Geronimo
------------------------------
To install, simply unpack the .zip (Windows) or tar.gz (Unix) file containing
Geronimo.

If you wish to modify the default ports that Geronimo will use, edit the file
<geronimo_home>/var/config/config.xml

Geronimo comes with batch and script files to control server start and stop
functions.  To see usage examples simply type geronimo.bat or geronimo.sh
command as appropriate for your platform.  It is necessary to set JAVA_HOME to
the copy of your Sun 5 JDK/JRE prior to executing the command.  

Here is an example to set JAVA_HOME:

export JAVA_HOME=<JDK/JRE_home>

To see the available command options type:

<geronimo_home>/bin/geronimo.sh
or
<geronimo_home>\bin\geronimo.bat

The command will display help text instructing you as to how to start and stop
the Geronimo server.

If you prefer to start the server without a script file you can simply type:

java -jar <geronimo_home>/bin/server.jar

Once the server has started, you can access the Geronimo Administration Console
at http://localhost:8080/console/ . The default user name is "system" and the
default password is "manager".


Administration Console Security Configuration
---------------------------------------------
The default administration user/password for the Geronimo Administration Console
and command line deployment tool is system/manager.  You can change these defaults
directly from the Geronimo Administration Console by accessing Security -> Console
Realm and change the user name and password from the Console Realm Users portlet.

As an alternative, you can make the same changes by editing the
<geronimo_home>/var/security/users.properties and
<geronimo_home>/var/security/groups.properties files.


Deploying Applications
----------------------
Geronimo comes with deploy scripts and batch files to deploy J2EE modules or
applications. You can use the scripts or simply invoke the executable jar by
running the following command (note that you need to start Geronimo first):

<geronimo_home>/bin/java -jar deployer.jar deploy my-web-app.war [deploy plan]

You will need to use the username "system" and password "manager" unless you
customized those as described above.  The deployment plan argument is
optional -- you can pack a deployment plan into the application module, provide
it on the command line, or in some cases omit it entirely.

You can also use the "Login" command to avoid entering a user name and password
every time you use the deploy tool

For more information on the commands and options supported by the deploy tool,
run from within the Geronimo directory <geronimo_home>/bin:

java -jar deployer.jar help [command]

You can also graphically deploy applications and resources via the Geronimo
Administration Console available at http://localhost:8080/console/


Other Deployment Options
------------------------
As an alternative to the command-line deployer, you can copy application
modules into the <geronimo_home>/deploy/ directory and the
hot deployer service will deploy them automatically.  The command-line deployer
has some advantages, as it will output any
deployment errors to its own console rather than just the server log.

Additionally, Geronimo provides a Maven plugin that can deploy applications to
Geronimo as part of a Maven build.


Configuration
-------------
Most configuration attributes can be updated in the
<geronimo_home>/var/config/config.xml file.  The attributes most likely to be
changed are already included in the supplied config.xml file, while others may
need to be added manually.
