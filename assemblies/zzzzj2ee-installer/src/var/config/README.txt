When Geronimo is started it will read a configuration XML file from this 
var/config directory.  By default the config.xml file is read, but an
alternative file can be used by setting the file name (relative to
the var/config directory) in the org.apache.geronimo.config.file system 
property.

The configuration XML file lists the serialized configurations in the 
repository to be started.  For each configuration configured to be
started in the config.xml file, Geronimo loads a serialized configuration 
from under the geronimo/repository directory.

A configuration can be marked as not to be loaded by setting the "load" attribute
to "false" on the "configuration" element for a configuration.

A configuration may contain GBeans.  Individual GBeans in a configuration can be
marked as not to be loaded by setting the "load" attribute to "false" on the
"gbean" element for a GBean.

Site specific information such as port numbers can be specified in GBean 
attributes to override the values in the serialized configuration.

Do not add comments to the config.xml file as the file is regenerated by 
Geronimo when changes are made to Geronimo's configuration, therefore any
comments added to this file will be lost.
