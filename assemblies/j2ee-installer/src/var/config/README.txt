When Geronimo is started it will read a configuration XML file from this 
var/config directory.  By default the name of the file is read is config.xml
but can be overridden by setting the org.apache.geronimo.config.file system 
property to the name of an alternative config file to use (relative to
the var/config directory).

The configuration XML file lists the serialized configurations in the 
config-store to be started.  For each configuration configured to be
started in the config.xml file, Geronimo looks up a serialized configuration 
by reading the geronimo/config-store/index.properties file that maps a 
configuration name to geronimo/config-store/n directory (where n is a 
numbered directory name).

A configuration can be marked as not to be loaded by setting the "load" attribute
to "false" on the "configuration" element for a configuration.

A configuration may contain GBeans.  Individual GBeans in a configuration can be
marked as not to be loaded by setting the "load" attribute to "false" on the
"gbean" element for a GBean.

Site specific information such as port numbers can be specified in GBean 
attributes to override the values in the serialized configuration.

Do not add comments to the config.xml file as the file is regenerated by 
Geronimo when changes are made to Geronimo's configuration, therefore any
comments added to this file will be lost.
