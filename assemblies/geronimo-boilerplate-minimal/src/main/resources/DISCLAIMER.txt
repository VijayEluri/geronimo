Apache Geronimo includes several Apache projects which are undergoing
incubation with the Apache Software Foundation. See
http://incubator.apache.org/ for information about the Apache
Incubator. 

A project undergoing incubation is required to provide a
disclaimer in any release. The disclaimers for the incubating projects
used by Apache Geronimo are aggregated below.

=========================================================================
==  Apache ActiveMQ Disclaimer                                         ==
=========================================================================

ActiveMQ is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Geronimo PMC. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that
the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
