This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the Java Community Process (JCP). The code is untested and presumed not to be a compatible implementation of the JSR-317 Java Persistence API, Version 2.0 specification.  We encourage you to migrate to an implementation of the JSR-317 Java Persistence API, Version 2.0 specification that has been tested and verified to be compatible as soon as such an implementation is available, and we encourage you to retain this notice in any implementation of JSR-317 Java Persistence API, Version 2.0 specification that you distribute.
