<p>This page lists the applications that have been installed in the server and whether they are running or stopped. There are four columns; two provide information and the other two allow user action. The first column indicates the state of the application, either &quot;stopped&quot; or &quot;running.&quot; The fourth column shows the configID of the application. The two remaining columns are:</p>
<table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

    <td class="LightBackground" style="padding: 10px 5px 10px 10px">The stop/start toggle can be clicked to stop or start an application. If the toggle says &quot;Stop&quot; the application is running so clicking on the Stop toggle will stop the application and vice versa.</td>
