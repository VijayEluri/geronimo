TODO:
 - extender needs to start tracking bundles only once kernel is fully initialized (all plugins are loaded)
 - rfc66 contextpath collision detection
 - for collision detection the extender will need to know all the contextPaths of other Java EE apps deployed
 - register ServerContext into service registry (Tomcat & Jetty)
 - extender needs to check/wait for web container to be available
