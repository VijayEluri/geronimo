System Requirements
-------------------
You need a platform that supports the Sun JDK 1.4.2.  CORBA
support requires a Sun Java 1.4.2 VM (specifically 1.4.2_08
or a higher 1.4.2_* release).

Most testing has been done on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.


Installing & Starting Geronimo
------------------------------
To install, simply unpack the .zip (Windows) or tar.gz (Unix) file 
containing Geronimo.

Documentation is included in the docs directory in your unpacked server.

If you wish to modify the default ports that 
Geronimo will use, edit the file var/config/config.xml in your 
Geronimo directory.

Geronimo comes with batch and script files to control server start 
and stop functions.  To see usage examples simply type geronimo.bat 
or geronimo.sh command as appropriate for your platform.  It is 
necessary to set JAVA_HOME to the copy of your Sun 1.4.2 JDK/JRE 
prior to executing the command.  Here is an example:

export JAVA_HOME=/directory_to_the_JRE/
bin/geronimo.sh

The command will display help text instructing you as to how to start 
and stop the Geronimo server.

If you prefer to start the server without a script file you can simply type: 

java -jar bin/server.jar

Once the server has started, you can access the administration console
at http://localhost:8080/console/ . The default user name is "system" and
the default password is "manager".


Administration Console Security Configuration
---------------------------------------------
The default administration user/password for the admin console and
deployment is system/manager.  To change this edit the
var/security/users.properties and var/security/groups.properties
files.


Deploying Applications
----------------------
Geronimo comes with deploy scripts and batch files to deploy J2EE
modules or applications. Alternatively, to deploy a J2EE module or 
application, start Geronimo and then run (for example):

   java -jar bin/deployer.jar deploy my-web-app.war [deploy plan]

You will need to use the username "system" and password "manager"
unless you customized those during the install process.  The
deployment plan argument is optional -- you can pack a deployment
plan into the application module, provide it on the command line,
or in some cases omit it entirely.

For more information on the commands and options supported by the
deploy tool, run

   java -jar bin/deployer.jar help [command]


Other Deployment Options
------------------------
As an alternative to the command-line deployer, you can copy
application modules into the geronimo/deploy/ directory and the
hot deployer service will deploy them automatically.  The
command-line deployer has some advantages, as it will output any
deployment errors to its own console rather than just the server
log, but either method will generally work.

Additionally, Geronimo provides a Maven plugin that can deploy
applications to Geronimo as part of a Maven build.


Future Road Map at a Glance

  (the above URL must be all on one line)


Significant Changes Since the M5 Release
----------------------------------------
 * the ConfigID format has been updated in anticipatation of future
   enhancements.  Application plans that include configIds of
   configurations included in Geronimo M5 and earlier will require
   modifications.  See the Wiki at http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo
   for more information.
 * More functionality and new look and feel for the Administrative
   Console (http://localhost:8080/console/)
 * Added HTTP session clustering to the Tomcat configuration
   included with Geronimo
 * Hot Deploy by copying your deployment artifact to the deploy/
   directory
 * Ability to run the deploy tool from a machine other than the
   application server (remote deployment)
 * Packages that represented experimental, pre-release or obsolete
   versions were removed.
 * Clustering
   - Tomcat support for clustering is available in this release.
   - WADI has been included as a technology preview for both Jetty
     and Tomcat.  See http://wadi.codehaus.org for additional
     information.


Choice of Web container
-----------------------
Two versions of the Geronimo binary are available for download.
There is a version for the Jetty Web container and a version for
the Tomcat Web container.  Both distributions are fully supported
by the Geronimo team.  Please download the binary appropriate for
your installation.


Configuration
-------------
Most configuration attributes can be updated in the
geronimo/var/config/config.xml file.  The attributes most likely
to be changed are already included in the supplied config.xml file,
while others may need to be added manually.


Overall Project Status
----------------------
The current version release of 1.0 represents a significant step
for the Geronimo  project.  After a little over two years of effort
this distribution is a fully compliant and usable J2EE container
suitable for everything from development to Enterprise deployments.

The next version of Geronimo is focused on several areas, including:

 * continue to enhance the performance and usability of the server
 * improve cross-platform compatibility
 * improve integration with third-party development tools and
   server products

User feedback is critical for future released to be successful!
The Geronimo team is anxious to gather feedback to ensure we are
meeting the needs and expectations of the user community.

In addition to the goals mentioned above, several specific changes
are currently being considered:

 * Make the Geronimo kernel pluggable, to help ease integration of
   external components. 
 * Enhance the ability to assemble customized servers (including only
   the services required by the applications to be run).
 * Enhance configuration, administration and management tools
 * Improve clustering support for web containers and ejbs

testing efforts, please visit JIRA, our bug/issue tracking system, at
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO


Certification Status
--------------------
Geronimo 1.0 has passed the J2EE(tm) certification test suite.  We
will be filing the appropriate certification paperwork with Sun for
official J2EE certification.


Significant Missing Features
----------------------------
 * J2EE Application Client that works from a machine other than the
   server
 * Full JSR-88 support for DConfig Beans (the current features are
   somewhat incomplete)
 * Offline deployment and assembly tools (expected shortly)
 * Installer program (expected shortly)


Known Issues
------------
 * ActiveMQ (our JMS implementation) is not shut down in the right
   way and thus tends to generate exceptions to the console during
   the shutdown process.  This does not cause any actual problems
   as far as we know, but it sure doesn't look nice.
