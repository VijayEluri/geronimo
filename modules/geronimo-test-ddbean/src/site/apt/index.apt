geronimo-test-ddbean

 A jsr-88 client that lets you edit spec deployment descriptors and vendor plans has to
 supply DDBeans to allow programatic access to the spec deployment descriptors.  Geronimo doesn't include
 any such editors but we do include some DConfigBeans for our plans.  Some of these need to traverse the
 spec deployment descriptors and we also have some tests that require DDBeans.  geronimo-test-ddbeans contains
 a simple implementation of DDBeans to support these scenarios.

 The DDBeans in this module allow access to the spec deployment descriptors.
 Do not confuse these with the DConfigBeans that allow access to geronimo plans.
