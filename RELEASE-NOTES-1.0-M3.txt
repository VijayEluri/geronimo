Current Project Status at a Glance
----------------------------------
http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/RoadMap


Significant Changes Since the M2 Release
----------------------------------------
 * CMP Entity beans are now supported.  However, there are still
   significant limitations (no EJB QL support).  This is one of the
   last outstanding core J2EE features.

 * Geronimo security realms have been integrated with the J2EE
   containers, so J2EE container-managed authentication works.

 * The web container now supports HTTPS with configurable SSL
   certificates, etc.

 * The transaction system is more robust, with bug fixes, transaction
   log support, etc.

 * An application client container is now included with Geronimo

 * Configuration changes to core Geronimo services and running
   applications are persisted, though we still lack a user-friendly
   interface for making such changes.

 * Manifest Class-Path entries in J2EE application modules are
   supported.

 * JDBC database pools and JMS connection factories, topics, and
   queues are now fully supported "out of the box".

 * When deploying a J2EE connector, multiple instances of the same
   resource adapter can be declared in the same deployment plan.

 * The command-line deployment tool supports authentication and hot
   deployment to a running server.

 * JAX-RPC and SAAJ features are available to applications acting as
   Web Services clients (though Web Services server features are not
   yet available)


Significant Missing Features
----------------------------
 * Full EJB CMP support with EJB QL

 * Message-Driven Beans support for JMS (currently present but buggy
   in comparison to non-JMS message sources)

 * A good management tool, capable of reconfiguring the core Geronimo
   services (such as setting a different default transaction timeout,
   changing default security realm, changing web container listen
   port, etc.)

 * A complete JSR-77 implementation, including the Management EJB

 * A complete JSR-88 configuration and deployment tool

 * JSR-88 support for Geronimo deployment plan configuration

 * Web Services server features and required J2EE features

 * Fully integrate Tomcat as an alternative to Jetty as the web
   container

 * Full functionality on non-Sun JVMs

 * Support for CORBA interoperability and distribution

 * Deployment tools should work from remote machines

 * Application client container should work from remote machines

 * Support for general JDBC XA drivers, and product-specific JDBC
   enhancements

 * Better features for migrating application and service
   configurations between different Geronimo servers

 * Ant tasks for common tasks (deployment, etc.)


Overall Project Status
----------------------
Geronimo has made great strides, and J2EE certification testing is
well underway.  However, it's probably clear from reading the notes
above, there's still a lot of work left.

In general, many core features work as expected, and many applications
(that do not depend too heavily on advanced EJB features) can be
successfully run on Geronimo.  Core services such as transactions and
security are available, (though the configuration can be onerous in
some areas).

There are a still a number of outstanding bugs, and Geronimo has not
been extensively performance tested.  Your help would be appreciated!

Documentation efforts are underway, and freely available documentation
covers many of the more stable aspects of the product.

testing efforts, please visit JIRA, our bug/issue tracking system, at
