RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

Currently the 1.1.1 release is addressing security issues that are related to CTS failures as well
as reworking our build and release process to address potential violations of Sun's License for the
specification related XSDs.  Our work around includes using XML beans to download and generate the
code necessary to manipulate the XSDs without including Sun's content in SVN or our released code.
