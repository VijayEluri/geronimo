RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

Certification - Historically certification has been the most time 
consuming portion of a release, and his release is proving to be no
different than the previous ones.  The biggest problem area is code 
related to the new CORBA ORB implementation Yoko.
 
Snapshots - Before a final release can be cut we need to resolve any 
SNAPSHOT dependencies must be replaced with final released versions.

Legal Review - There are many items in this category, but at the very
lease all source files must have the current Apache license header and all 
archives must contain LICENSE, NOTICE and DISCLAIMER files as required by 
the ASF.
