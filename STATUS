Upcoming Releases:

    Release Manager: Dain Sundstrom and Alan Cabrera
    Estimated Date: Q4 2006


    
RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

Certification - Historically certification has been the most time consuming 
portion of a release, and there is no reason to expect it to be any different 
for this release.  To make matters worse, the certification test suite was not 
run for several months while major changes were made to the build, EJB, 
Transaction, Connector and Servlet Session.    

In the last two weeks we have gotten the TCK running and using Maven 2, and
have made good progress on the test suite.  Additionally, the GBuild servers
are back online and processing some tests.  There are stability issues with
GBuild but we are hopeful it will be fully running soon.
 
Currently, the biggest concerns for the TCK are ActiveMQ 4 and Yoko.  Both
of these are new libraries and may take a considerable amount of effort to 
certify.  Also, there are few people that understand these new libraries,
the geronimo integrations, and the TCK.  In the case of ActiveMQ, the one 
person that understands that can certify the code, is unavailable for the 
next two weeks.

Fit and Finish - This is another item that has historically taken a 
significant amount of time to complete.  A process has been started to 
tie up the loose ends in the software so it can be released.


Dead 1.2 - There are still 30 unmerged commits the dead 1.2 branch.  These 
commits must be merged before the 1.2 release.  The current status of the 
dead-1.2 changes can be found at
