/**
 * A servlet that accepts file uploads.  It takes only POST requests, which should
 * contain a Java "DataOutput" formatted stream containing:
 *
 * 1) an int, the number of files being uploaded
 * 2) for each file:
 *    1) an int, the length of the file in bytes
 *    2) a number of raw bytes equal to the above for the file
 *
 * It returns a serialized stream containing:
 *
 * 1) a UTF string, the status (should be "OK")
 * 2) an int, the number of files received
 * 3) for each file:
 *    1) a UTF String, the path to the file as saved to the server's filesystem
 *
 * The file positions in the response will be the same as in the request.
 * The is, a name for upload file #2 will be in response position #2.
