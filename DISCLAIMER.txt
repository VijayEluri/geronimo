Apache Geronimo includes several Apache projects which are undergoing
incubation with the Apache Software Foundation. See
http://incubator.apache.org/ for information about the Apache
Incubator. 

A project undergoing incubation is required to provide a
disclaimer in any release. The disclaimers for the incubating projects
used by Apache Geronimo are aggregated below.

=========================================================================
==  Apache ActiveMQ Disclaimer                                         ==
=========================================================================

The Apache ActiveMQ project has graduated from the Apache Incubator. 
However, Geronimo includes a component of the ActiveMQ project that
was released while ActiveMQ was an incubating project.

ActiveMQ is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Geronimo PMC. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that
the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

=========================================================================
==  Apache Yoko Disclaimer                                             ==
=========================================================================

Yoko is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a
manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.
