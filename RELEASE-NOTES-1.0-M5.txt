System Requirements
-------------------
You need a platform that supports JDK 1.4 (and some features
such as CORBA currently depend on Sun implementation classes and
are known to not work under 1.5, so a Sun 1.4.2_08 JVM would be the
best bet).

Most testing has been done on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.


Installing & Starting Geronimo
------------------------------
To install, simply unpack the zip or tar file containing Geronimo,
or run the installer package for a more interactive installation
process (including the ability to change ports and the default
administrator account)

To start Geronimo, change to the Geronimo directory and run

   java -jar bin/server.jar


Deploying Applications
------------------------------
To deploy a J2EE module or application, start Geronimo and then
run (for example):

   java -jar bin/deployer.jar deploy my-web-app.war [deploy plan]

You will need to use the username "system" and password "manager"
unless you customized those during the install process.

For more information on the commands and options supported by the
deploy tool, run

   java -jar bin/deployer.jar help [command]

Significant Changes Since the M5 Release
----------------------------------------
 * Complete Tomcat integration
 * A web management console (developer preview)
 * Official J2EE Certification 


Significant Missing Features
----------------------------
 * Fully featured web management console
 * Deployment from a machine other than the server
 * J2EE Application Client that works from a machine other than the server
 * A build that uses Tomcat by default (Tomcat can be activated as a
   manual process, but as of M5 we will be distributing both Jetty and
   Tomcat builds)
 * A hot deploy directory (though the deploy tool can hot deploy)
 * JSR-88 support for Geronimo deployment plan configuration
 * Full functionality on non-Sun JVMs (a portable CORBA implementation
   is not expected for version 1.0)
 * Clustering (also not expected for version 1.0)


Overall Project Status
----------------------
Many of the remaining changes are focused on usability at this time.
However, Geronimo has also not been extensively performance tested.
Your help would be appreciated!

Documentation efforts are underway, and freely available documentation
covers many aspects of the product.

For more information on specific bugs or features, or to help with
testing efforts, please visit JIRA, our bug/issue tracking system, at

Certification Status
--------------------
Geronimo is pursuing full J2EE certification (it's not enough to just
pass the automated tests).  Stay tuned!
