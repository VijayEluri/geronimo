System Requirements
-------------------
You need a platform that supports JDK 1.4 (and some features
such as CORBA currently depend on Sun implementation classes and
are known to not work under 1.5, so a Sun 1.4.2_08 JVM would be the
best bet).

Most testing has been done on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.


Installing & Starting Geronimo
------------------------------
To install, simply unpack the zip or tar file containing Geronimo,
or run the installer package for a more interactive installation
process (including the ability to change ports and the default
administrator account)

To start Geronimo, change to the Geronimo directory and run

   java -jar bin/server.jar


Deploying Applications
------------------------------
To deploy a J2EE module or application, start Geronimo and then
run (for example):

   java -jar bin/deployer.jar deploy my-web-app.war [deploy plan]

You will need to use the username "system" and password "manager"
unless you customized those during the install process.

For more information on the commands and options supported by the
deploy tool, run

   java -jar bin/deployer.jar help [command]

Significant Changes Since the M4 Release
----------------------------------------
 * Complete Tomcat integration
 * Configuration of ports, hosts, and most other attributes without rebuilding the server
 * A web management console (developer preview)
 * Official J2EE Certification

Choice of Web container
-----------------------
Geronimo M5 ships with both jetty and tomcat web containers running.
Most likely you want only one of these. We have provided configuration files
for jetty-only and tomcat-only configurations.  To change to one of these configurations,
go to the var/config directory and copy the appropriate files to config.list and config.xml,
e.g.
cp config.jetty.list config.list
cp config.jetty.xml config.xml


Configuration
-------------
Most gbean attributes can be configured using the config.xml file.  The attributes most likely
to be changed are already included in the supplied config.xml file.


Significant Missing Features
----------------------------
 * Fully featured web management console
 * Deployment from a machine other than the server
 * J2EE Application Client that works from a machine other than the server
 * A hot deploy directory (though the deploy tool can hot deploy)
 * JSR-88 support for Geronimo deployment plan configuration
 * Full functionality on non-Sun JVMs (a portable CORBA implementation
   is not expected for version 1.0)
 * Clustering (also not expected for version 1.0)


Overall Project Status
----------------------
Many of the remaining changes are focused on usability at this time.
However, Geronimo has also not been extensively performance tested.
Your help would be appreciated!

Documentation efforts are underway, and freely available documentation
covers many aspects of the product.

testing efforts, please visit JIRA, our bug/issue tracking system, at

Certification Status
--------------------
Geronimo 1.0 M5 has passed the j2ee certification test suite.  We will
be filing the appropriate certification paperwork with Sun for official
J2ee certification.
