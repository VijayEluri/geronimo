<h1>Reusable Services</h1>

We hope to make use of the following fine open source software to help complete make the Geronimo J2EE stack...

<ul>
<li>
MX4J for JMX 
</li>
<li>
Tomcat or Jetty for Web Container 
Axis for Web Services Stack 
</li>
<li>
James for email 
</li>
<li>
OJB for JDO & plugins to the CMP engine (Hibernate is LGPL to the bindings to Geronimo must be outside of Apache)
</li>
<li>
commons-jndi for JNDI - 
(There is currently a JNDI implementation in Tomcat's CVS. It might be better to 
move this to Jakarta Commons so we can all work & extend it - there are various 
features from Jetty and OpenEjb ?we'd like to add? ). 
</li>
<li>
OpenJms ?for JMS 
</li>
<li>
Tyrex for Transaction Manager 
</li>
</ul>
