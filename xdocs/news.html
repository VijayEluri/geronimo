The Apache Software Foundation has sent a response to the attorneys representing
JBoss Inc. detailing our conclusions related to the letter from Oct 31, 2003.

<h4>2003-11-18</h4>
<p>
The Apache Software Foundation becomes the first open-source J2EE(tm) TCK licensee.  Taking advantage
of the result of changes to the Java Community Process that allow open source implementations of
Java specificaitons, the Geronimo project is now able to test and certify the codebase.  Testing
will begin at the appropriate time.

<h4>2003-11-11</h4>
<p>
We have recieved a mail  <a href="20031031_jboss.pdf">a letter on behalf of
the JBoss Group, LCC dated October 31, 2003</a> that asks for clarifications regarding 
similarity between parts of the Geronimo codebase and the JBoss codebase. 
We are in the process of actively reviewing not only the specific claims but also the code base in general.
