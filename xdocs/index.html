<h1>Introduction</h1>

Welcome to Geronimo, Apache's J2EE project. 
Please help us make this a world class, certified J2EE container!
<br>

<h2>Background</h2>

The Java 2, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform is employed widely by 
organizations implementing enterprise applications. It is commonly used in 
business-to-consumer and most recently in Web service deployments. 
Most of the largest business organizations today have deployed applications 
on a J2EE platform. 
<br>
While the J2EE specification is implemented by a number of large and small
vendors, there is no open source J2EE container available with a BSD or 
BSD-derived licence nor is there an open source project today that provides 
a fully compliant implementation.  Verifiable compliance with the J2EE 
specification is important to business because it ensures that applications 
deployed by developers are portable and interoperable across J2EE providers. 
As a result organizations large and small have felt compelled to pay 
thousands of dollars to commercial vendors in order to deploy applications 
based on J2EE compliant servers. 
<br>
The Apache foundation supports several projects that implement pieces of the 
J2EE platform such as Servlets, JSP, Tag Libraries, and a Web services stack. 
However, Apache does not currently support a J2EE project. 
<br>
The aim of the project is to produce a large and healthy community of J2EE 
developers tasked with the development of an open source, certified J2EE 
server, that is ASF licensed and passes Sun's TCK reusing the best ASF/BSD 
licensed code available today and adding new code to complete the J2EE stack.
