       Note the parent's artifactid. Ideally, we would have liked to make this the child of the deployment-testsuite. 
       But since the packaging here is "pom", it will expect the parent (deployment-testsuite) to already belong in the repo.
       Hence using this artifactId as the parent.
       
       We would liked to have included the test pom here at the end of <modules>. But since this pom belongs to a different parent,
       it does not inherit any configuration from the testsuite framework. So it's reports do not get aggregated with those of the testsuites.
       Hence the app is built here whie it's tests are done in deployment-testsuite/test-manifestcp
