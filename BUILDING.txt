Welcome to Geronimo
===================

To build me please install Maven from here - version 1.0.2 or later.

	http://maven.apache.org/

In addition you should have JDK 1.4.x installed with JAVA_HOME
environment defined to point to this JDK.

In the following examples, '$>' is your prompt, so if you see 
'$> maven', at your prompt, type in 'maven' (without the quotes) 
and then press [enter].

To build Geronimo running all of the unit test cases, compiling 
all the Geronimo sources and installing them in your local maven
repository, simply type maven in the root of the Geronimo source
tree:

        $> maven

That command will compile Geronimo, using recent binary builds of
OpenEJB and TranQL.  In some cases synchronized changes are made
to several of the projects at once, and you may have trouble
building the HEAD code of Geronimo against the older binaries of
OpenEJB of TranQL.  In that case, you can run:

	$> maven m:co
	$> maven m:rebuild-all

The first command checks out the latest OpenEJB and TranQL code,
while the second cleans and previous build output and rebuilds
Geronimo, OpenEJB, and TranQL from scratch.

To build and run the server, change into the assembly directory and
type:
	
        $> cd modules/assembly
        $> maven
        $> cd target/geronimo-1.0-SNAPSHOT
        $> java -jar bin/server.jar org/apache/geronimo/Server

To stop the server use ctrl-C or an equivalent; a proper shutdown
command will be made available in a future release.  
(See http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/Running for more information).

To do a clean rebuild of Geronimo type

        $> maven rebuild

         -or (a slower option)-

        $> maven clean
        $> maven

To only build select modules (assumes that depends are installed
already):

        $> maven -Dmodules=common,core

To clean your workspace:
	
        $> maven clean

NOTE: You need to build the server first for this to work due to 
      a problem with dependencies & the reactor.

To removal all build generated files:

        $> maven clobber

For the HTML website:

        $> maven site
