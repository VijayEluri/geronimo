Welcome to Apache Geronimo
==========================

To build you will need:

 * J2SE SDK 1.4.2+ (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2)
 * Maven 2.0.4+ (http://maven.apache.org)

NOTE: If you use JDK 1.5 you may run into unexpected errors, so stick to 1.4.

For detail instructions please see:

Building Geroniomo
==================

To build all changes incrementally:

    mvn install

To perform clean builds, which are sometimes needed after some changes to the 
source tree:

    mvn clean install


Testing the Build
=================

The end result of a successful build will be a set of functional distributions.
To test the build, simply start the server:

    mvn -Ptools geronimo:start
    ...
    CTRL-C or from another terminal: mvn -Ptools geronimo:stop


Generating a Site
=================

There are several really annonying bugs in the site builds, mostly due to the
maven-clover-plugin.

To build the site you need to first, build as in:

    mvn clean install

And then:

    mvn site -Denv=site

If you attempt to run `mvn clean install site` strange errors are bound to occur
which will drive you crazy and you may start pulling your hairout... so its not
recommended.

It is important to specify `-Denv=site` to limit the modules which are processed,
as many of the configs modules will freakout.
