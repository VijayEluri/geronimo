Welcome to Apache Geronimo
==========================
 
To build me please install Maven from here - version 1.0.2 or later.

	http://maven.apache.org/

In addition you should have JDK 1.4.x installed with JAVA_HOME
environment defined to point to this JDK.

In the following examples, '$>' is your prompt, so if you see 
'$> maven', at your prompt, type in 'maven' (without the quotes) 
and then press [enter].

To build Geronimo running all of the unit test cases, compiling 
all the Geronimo sources and installing them in your local maven
repository, simply type "maven" in the root of the Geronimo
source tree:

        $> maven

That command will run the default "new" target and compile 
Geronimo, using recent binary builds of OpenEJB and build j2ee-jetty-server
and j2ee-tomcat-server assemblies. 

In some cases synchronized changes are made to several of the 
dependent projects at once, and you may have trouble building the HEAD code 
of Geronimo against the older binaries of OpenEJB.  
In that case, you can run:

1.	$> maven m:co
	$> maven m:rebuild-all

The first command checks out the latest OpenEJB code,
while the second cleans and previous build output and rebuilds
Geronimo, OpenEJB from scratch. You can stop the build when you get to the
assembly module, and certainly when you get to itests.

2. build the plugins explicitly:

      $> cd plugins
      $> maven -o multiproject:install
      $> cd ..

3. build the configs:

      $> cd configs
      $> maven -o multiproject:install
      $> cd ..

This step uses the packaging plugin to build all the
configurations we need for both jetty and tomcat servers, and installs
them in your local maven repo as .car files.

4. build the servers:

      $> cd assemblies
      $> cd j2ee-jetty-server
      $> maven -o clean default

                OR 

      $> cd ../j2ee-tomcat-server
      $> maven -o clean default

To run the server :

      $> cd assemblies/j2ee-jetty-server/target/geronimo-1.1-SNAPSHOT

or

      $> cd assemblies/j2ee-tomcat-server/target/geronimo-1.1-SNAPSHOT

and finally execute the following command:

      $> java -jar bin/server.jar
	
NOTE: The configIds of these configurations are incompatible with 
      the configIds used by the previous assembly.  If you deploy 
      anything on these servers and you specify a parentId or an
      import you will have to modify them.

To stop the server :

       $ java -jar bin/shutdown.jar 

(See http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/Running for more information).

To do a clean rebuild of Geronimo type

        $> maven rebuild

         -or (a slower option)-

        $> maven clean
        $> maven

To only build select modules (assumes that depends are installed
already):

        $> maven -Dmodules=common,core

To clean your workspace:
	
        $> maven clean

NOTE: You need to build the server first for this to work due to 
      a problem with dependencies and the reactor.

To removal all build generated files:

        $> maven clobber

For the HTML website:

        $> maven site

Have fun!
