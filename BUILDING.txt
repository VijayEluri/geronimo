Welcome to Apache Geronimo
==========================

To build you will need:

 * J2SE SDK 1.4.2+ (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2)
 * Maven 2.0.4+ (http://maven.apache.org)

NOTE: If you use JDK 1.5 you may run into unexpected errors, so stick to 1.4.

For detail instructions please see:

    http://cwiki.apache.org/GMOxDEV/building-apache-geronimo-with-maven-2.html


Building for the first time
===========================

Currently to ensure that your build works you should bootstrap, which will
clean your local Maven 2 repository, download some sources and build them
and kick off the Geronimo build.

To start the bootstrap build simply:

    ./bootstrap

NOTE: Windows users will need Cygwin to execute this script.

The end result will be a set of functional distributions in m2-assemblies/*/target
which you can unpack and startup, as in:

    gunzip -c m2-assemblies/geronimo-jetty-j2ee/target/geronimo-jetty-j2ee*-bin.tar.gz | tar xf -
    ./geronimo-jetty-j2ee*/bin/startup.sh
    ...
    ./geronimo-jetty-j2ee*/bin/shutdown.sh


Subsequent builds
=================

After the initial bootstrap build, the `mvn` command can be used.

To build all changes incrementally:

    mvn install

To perform clean builds, which are sometimes needed after some changes to the 
source tree:

    mvn clean install


Generating a Site
=================

There are several really annonying bugs in the site builds, mostly due to the
maven-clover-plugin.

To build the site you need to first, build as in:

    mvn clean install

And then:

    mvn site -Denv=site

If you attempt to run `mvn clean install site` strange errors are bound to occur
which will drive you crazy and you may start pulling your hairout... so its not
recommended.

It is important to specify `-Denv=site` to limit the modules which are processed,
as many of the configs modules will freakout.
