Welcome to Geronimo
===================
 
To build me please install Maven from here - version 1.0.2 or later.

	http://maven.apache.org/

In addition you should have JDK 1.4.x installed with JAVA_HOME
environment defined to point to this JDK.

In the following examples, '$>' is your prompt, so if you see 
'$> maven', at your prompt, type in 'maven' (without the quotes) 
and then press [enter].

To build Geronimo running all of the unit test cases, compiling 
all the Geronimo sources and installing them in your local maven
repository, simply type "maven" in the root of the Geronimo
source tree:

        $> maven 

That command will run the default "new" target and compile 
Geronimo, using recent binary builds of OpenEJB and TranQL.  In 
some cases synchronized changes are made to several of the 
projects at once, and you may have trouble building the HEAD code 
of Geronimo against the older binaries of OpenEJB of TranQL.  
In that case, you can run:

	$> maven m:co
	$> maven m:clean m:clean-repo new

The first command checks out the latest OpenEJB and TranQL code,
while the second cleans and previous build output and rebuilds
Geronimo, OpenEJB, and TranQL from scratch.

To run the server, change into one of the assemblies directory
and start the server using a command like this:
	
        $> cd assemblies/j2ee-jetty-server
        $> cd target/geronimo-1.0
        $> java -jar bin/server.jar

To stop the server use ctrl-C or use the shutdown JAR.
(See http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/Running for more information).

To do a clean rebuild of Geronimo type

        $> maven m:clean m:clean-repo new

To only build select modules (assumes that depends are installed
already):

        $> maven -Dmodules=common,core

To clean your workspace:
	
        $> maven clean

NOTE: You need to build the server first for this to work due to 
      a problem with dependencies & the reactor.

To removal all build generated files:

        $> maven clobber
