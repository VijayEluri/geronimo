System Requirements
-------------------
You need a platform that supports JDK 1.4 (and some features
such as CORBA currently depend on Sun implementation classes and
are known to not work under 1.5, so a Sun 1.4.x JVM would be the
best bet).

Most testing has been done on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.


Installing & Starting Geronimo
------------------------------
To install, simply unpack the zip or tar file containing Geronimo,
or run the installer package for a more interactive installation
process (including the ability to change ports and the default
administrator account)

To start Geronimo, change to the Geronimo directory and run

   java -jar bin/server.jar


Deploying Applications
------------------------------
To deploy a J2EE module or application, start Geronimo and then
run (for example):

   java -jar bin/deployer.jar deploy my-web-app.war [deploy plan]

You will need to use the username "system" and password "manager"
unless you customized those during the install process.

For more information on the commands and options supported by the
deploy tool, run

   java -jar bin/deployer.jar help [command]


Current Project Status at a Glance
----------------------------------
http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/RoadMap


Significant Changes Since the M3 Release
----------------------------------------
 * EJB support is complete
 * Web Services support is complete
 * JSR-77 support, including the Management EJB
 * Securty configuration has changed dramatically
 * The current Geronimo code passes the J2EE TCK tests, but has not
   yet been certified.


Significant Missing Features
----------------------------
 * A web management console
 * Deployment from a machine other than the server
 * A build that uses Tomcat by default (Tomcat can be activated as a
   manual process, but as of M5 we will be distributing both Jetty and
   Tomcat builds)
 * A hot deploy directory (though the deploy tool can hot deploy)
 * JSR-88 support for Geronimo deployment plan configuration
 * Full functionality on non-Sun JVMs (a portable CORBA implementation
   is not expected for version 1.0)
 * Clustering (not expected for version 1.0)


Overall Project Status
----------------------
Geronimo has passed the TCK certification tests, meaning that all J2EE
features should work as expected. Many of the remaining changes are
focused on usability at this time.  However, Geronimo has also not
been extensively performance tested.  Your help would be appreciated!

Documentation efforts are underway, and freely available documentation
covers many aspects of the product.
