NOTE: THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER.  THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN OFFICIAL M4 RELEASE
YET.  YOU MAY LOOK AT THE FILE RELEASE-NOTES-1.0-M3.txt IN YOUR
GERONIMO DISTRIBUTION FOR THE RELEASE NOTES FROM THE LAST MILESTONE, BUT
THOSE ARE SOMEWHAT OUT OF DATE.

System Requirements
-------------------
You need a platform that supports JDK 1.4 or JDK 1.5 (and some
features such as HTTPS currently depend on Sun implementation
classes, so a Sun JVM would be the best bet).

Most testing has been done on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.  For a
list of notes on specific configurations, see
http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/KnownWorkingConfigurations

Installing & Starting Geronimo
------------------------------
To install, simply unpack the zip or tar file containing Geronimo.

To start Geronimo, change to the Geronimo directory and run

   java -jar bin/server.jar

Overall Project Status
----------------------
Geronimo is currently undergoing TCK testing.  Many features work, but
it is not fully J2EE compliant yet.  Geronimo has also not been
extensively performance tested.  Your help would be appreciated!

Documentation efforts are underway, and freely available documentation
covers many of the more stable aspects of the product.
